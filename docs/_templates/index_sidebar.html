<h1><strong>WELCOME TO OUR DOCUMENTATION SITE</strong></h1>
<p>Kytos is a project composed of several subprojects and each has its own documentation. But here we try to better organize ideas and provide a starting point to help you find the right documentation.</p>
<p>Also, is important to say that everything that you need to know about the Kytos project, should be here. So if you are trying to find any information and did not found, please don't be shy, open a issue and help us to make a better documentation.</p>
<p>Besides this documentation, you can ask for help in our mailing lists and in our communication channels (Slack or IRC).</p>
